Accident Alert System using GPS and GSM Module
Overview
This project is an Accident Alert System that uses GPS and GSM modules to detect accidents and send immediate alerts to pre-defined contacts with the location of the accident. The system is designed to provide timely assistance by informing emergency contacts of an accident's location, potentially saving lives.

Features
Accident Detection: The system detects accidents based on the sensor input (e.g., vibration sensor, accelerometer).
Real-time Location Tracking: Utilizes a GPS module to get the precise location of the accident.
Immediate Alert: Sends an SMS alert with the accident location to predefined emergency contacts using a GSM module.
Automatic Operation: Once an accident is detected, the system operates automatically without requiring any manual input.
